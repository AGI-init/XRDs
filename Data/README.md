[Zhatong Du's](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/me/sites/abdolrahim/people/alumni/zhaotong-du/index.html) master's thesis describes the full XRD generation, from CIF file to simulated diffraction to readiness for training. It can be found [here](MS_Dissertation_Zhaotong_Du.pdf) and is a worthwhile read. See ```2.1``` for instructions on how to download the ICSD CIF files. Note: they are not open-access and require special permission. 

Thankfully [ma921 have provided a download reference](https://github.com/ma921/XRDidentifier/blob/main/COD-selection.txt) for the open-access CIF files used here by default.

The experimental real-world data comes from the [RRUFF Project website](https://rruff.info) and is already downloaded/included in this GitHub repo.
